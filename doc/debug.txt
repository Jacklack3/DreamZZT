DreamZZT Debug Console
======================

DreamZZT includes a debug console that allows you to view ZZT-OOP as it runs,
as well as perform various operations on the game world.  To show or hide the
debug console, press the tilde key during a game.

Below is a description of the currently supported debug commands.  The debug
console also allows you to execute ZZT-OOP statements directly.  Some useful
ZZT-OOP commands are "change invisible normal" to change all invisible walls
to normal walls, and "give health 100" to increase your health by 100.

+ammo / -ammo: Increases or decreases the player's ammo by 10.

+dark / -dark: Toggles darkness on the current board.

edit: Enter the editor.

flags: Display all the ZZT flags that are currently set.

freeze / unfreeze: Pause and unpause the game world.  This does not affect
the player, only the other objects on the board.

+gems / -gems: Increases or decreases the player's gems by 10.

+health / -health: Increases or decreases the player's health by 10.

inspect: Displays the ZZT-OOP program for the selected object.

keys: Gives the player all the keys.

quit: Quit DreamZZT.

+reveal / -reveal: Highlight all ZZT-OOP objects on the board.

+score / -score: Increases or decreases the player's score by 10.

+torch / -torch: Increases or decreases the player's torches by 10.

warp: Switch to a different board.  'warp' by itself will display a list
of boards to choose from.  If you know the board's number, you can instead 
use 'warp x' where x is the board number to warp to.

watch: Allows you to select a ZZT-OOP object to watch.  All ZZT-OOP commands
that are executed by that object will be displayed in the debug console.

zap: Clears the spaces north, south, east, and west of the player.
