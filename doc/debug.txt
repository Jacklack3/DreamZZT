DreamZZT Debug Console
======================

DreamZZT includes a debug console that allows you to view ZZT-OOP as it runs,
as well as perform various operations on the game world.  To show or hide the
debug console, press the tilde key during a game.

Below is a description of the currently supported debug commands.  The debug
console also allows you to execute ZZT-OOP statements directly, which will
not be covered here.

+ammo / -ammo: Increases or decreases the player's ammo by 10

+dark / -dark: Toggles darkness on the current board

freeze / unfreeze: Pause and unpause the game world.  This does not affect
the player, only the other objects on the board.

+gems / -gems: Increases or decreases the player's gems by 10

+health / -health: Increases or decreases the player's health by 10

keys: Gives the player all the keys

+score / -score: Increases or decreases the player's score by 10

+torch / -torch: Increases or decreases the player's torches by 10

warp: Switch to a different board.  'warp' by itself will display a list
of boards to choose from.  If you know the board's number, you can instead 
use 'warp x' where x is the board number to warp to.

zap: Clears the spaces north, south, east, and west of the player
